# pysc2 agents

This is a simple implementation of DeepMind's pysc2 agents.
Pysc2 is DeepMind's python component of the StarCraft II
learning environment, which provides an interface for RL
agents to interact with StarCraft  II, getting observations
and sending actions.

We define the agents according to the original paper
[StarCraft II: A New Challenge for Reinforcement Learning](https://deepmind.com/documents/110/sc2le.pdf).
